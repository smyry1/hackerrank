--Problem
/*
You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges.

Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score.
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.
*/

--Solution

SELECT
m.hacker_id,h.name,
SUM(score) AS total_score
FROM (SELECT hacker_id, challenge_id, MAX(score) AS score
      FROM Submissions GROUP BY hacker_id,challenge_id) AS m
INNER JOIN Hackers h ON h.hacker_id = m.hacker_id
GROUP BY m.hacker_id,h.name
HAVING total_score > 0 
ORDER BY total_score DESC,m.hacker_id ASC;
